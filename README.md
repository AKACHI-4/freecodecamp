# FCC on Zim

This project consists of two major components:

- Builder - The scripts (python) that fetch the latest FCC curriculum and package it into a format client can read, as well as our zim builder
- Client - A vite app configured to be consumed by a Zim reader, it pull curriculum which is generated by the Builder scripts

## Development

#### Prerequsites

- Node 18.x
- Python 3

This project comes with .devcontainer to help onboard new developers, with Node 18 and Python3 installed

The basic steps to build are as follows:

1. Use fetch.py to grab the latest curriculum (`python3 fetch.py --filter=02-javascript` which will limit the curriculum set to just javascript)
2. Build the require curriculum for consumption by the web client (`python3 prebuild.py basic-javascript ../client/src/assets/curriculum`)
3. Build the web client (`yarn build` inside the `client` directory)
3. Package the web client into a Zim file (`python3 ./fcc2zim --source-dir=../client/dist --zim`)

See: `quickstart.st` for a full build script
