# FCC on Zim

This project consists of two major components:

- Openzim - The scripts (python) that fetch the latest FCC curriculum and package it into a format client can read, as well as our zim builder
- Client - A vite app configured to be consumed by a Zim reader, it pull curriculum which is generated by the Builder scripts

## freeCodeCamp Zim build process

This process can be broken down into 5 parts

1. Fetch the latest curriculum from freeCodeCamp by downloading the latest release source archive
1. "Prebuild" the curriculum for a selected langauge and set of courses. Copy only the required markdown files and i18n locales.
1. Build the Vite client bundled with the curriculum and locale information.
1. Build a Zim file of the resulting Vite application.
